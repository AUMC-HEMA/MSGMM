# MSGMM

## What is `MSGMM`?

MSGMM allows for efficiently fitting a Gaussian mixture models (GMM) to multiple samples simultaniously using the EM algorithm. 

## Installation

`MSGMM` is installable in R from Github and can be installed via `devtools`:

```r
devtools::install_github("AUMC-HEMA/MSGMM")
```
Note that MSGMM also requires installing [RTools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).
